The Read Me Generator is a node js program which takes inputs from the end user to create a professional README.md file that they can use for their own individual or commercial projects. The program uses inquirer.js as an interactive command line interface that can acquire relevant information and fs  to write the file. this project was also an opportunity to start using arrow functions which can be found throughout the index.js files and  to utilise the updates that come with ES6 e.g. string literals.
